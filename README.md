# my-agile-app 
The application is working properly as tested and implements a messaging system with mockup users in code
You should have node.js installed to run the app with "npm start". That will run app.js which is in the root
NOTE: the server listens on port 3000. so after running "npm start" go with your browser to "localhost:3000"
the application uses pug rendering to render the pug files into html
views/index.pug  is the main screen. app.js listens on the url / (root) to render it
the JSON file  which serves as a logfile can be found in public/messageslogfile.json
users and classes and functions can be found in public/javascripts/submitmessages.js
the table in the mainscreen is populatet through code found in public/javascripts/myscripts.jsb
